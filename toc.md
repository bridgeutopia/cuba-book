# What is Cuba?

Cuba is a microframework for web development originally inspired by [Rum][rum],
a tiny but powerful mapper for [Rack][rack] applications.

It integrates many templates via [Tilt][tilt], it's very easy to test
with either [rack-test][rack-test] or [Capybara][capybara].

# Cuba Contrib

Over the course of the years, we've been able to identify the most basic
set of features that we've needed for the majority of our projects. We've
extracted most of these in a plugin, so others can benefit from our work.
